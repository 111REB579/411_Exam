### A Short Description of Application. (Inspiration & What the project does)
The script is designed to search and compare different facts that are described in tweets. The essence of the script is simple analyzes tweets in the given parameters statistically calculates and gives the best result by the number of tweets
### A little history of the script (Built with idea)
The idea came by itself, my friend, who is engaged in marketing at the company and manages Instagram and Twitter accounts, asked if it was possible to make them fill themselves with news. Then the search for information began on how to do this...
### Architecture or how i built it? (Development)
Of course, it wasn't without third-party sources, I found the raw code at the link: https://github.com/Dhrumilcse/twitter-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/sentiment.py (thanks to the author). I supplemented it with several functions such as statistics and clearing a tweet from massive information. Of course, the code itself had to be changed because it did not have a secrecy rule. The code is very simple, one can say of 5 parts: authorization and test environment, the next one is collecting data (tweets), further clearing of massive information, the next two blocks go to statistics, counting the results, and the last output of the result.
### Achievement
The main achievement can be noted: IT WORKS. I learned quite interesting algorithms for the api socket, (it was interesting to create my own new account for development in the Twitter environment), the work of the token, keys and other sensitive things
### what's in the future
